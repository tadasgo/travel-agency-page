### Stuff I learned and explored

- Package management with NPM.
- Better code organisation:
  - Classes and BEM - I used to miss a lot of opportunities to both structure my CSS and reuse already written code.
  - I made my JS a lot neater by the use of classes.
  - I got used to GIT version control, branching of different features and all of the advantages it gives.
- Explored responsive images by setting up different crop and/or resolution images to be downloaded depending on the screen size and layout.
- Bundling files & Webpack
  - Tried PostCSS - compact alterantive to SASS preprocessor with some additional bells and whistles like autoprefixer.
  
  - Setted up a dev server to inject updated JS and CSS straight into browsers memory without full page reload.
  
  - Asynchronous picture loading - loved the power Lazysizes package provides and simplicity of implementing it.
  
  - Setting up files for distribution - it was harder than I expected..
